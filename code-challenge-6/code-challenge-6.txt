You are given a TypeScript interface 'Employee' that represents an employee with 'id', 'name', 
and 'salary'. Implement a function 'filterHighEarningEmployees' that takes an array of 'Employee' 
objects and a 'threshold' salary value. The function should return an array of Employee objects 
whose salary is greater than the threshold.

REQUIREMENTS
- Implement the function 'filterHighEarningEmployees' according to the interface provided.
- Do not modify the input array directly.
- Ensure the function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of employees.
